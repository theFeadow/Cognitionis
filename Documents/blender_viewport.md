# The Blender Viewport

The viewport is where the user views and mainpulates their object(s) while modelling/designing.

However, there are various different what we can call "viewing modes" in the viewport. Blender defines them as "methods to display/shade objects in the 3D View". There are 4 of these:

1. Wireframe
2. Solid
3. Material Preview
4. Rendered

#### Solid Mode

'Solid' mode is the default viewing mode. It's basically good for viewing shapes and geometry, but not materials and shading.

#### Wireframe Mode

Self-explanatory.

#### Material Preview Mode

For viewing materials and colours. It has another very cool use that you can find in [[blender_rendering|D#d2d1rz]].

#### Rendered Mode

For viewing the object as if it was rendered from that angle - ray-tracing is applied (or simulated). More computationally intensive than other modes, especially when used with Cycles engine. Check out [[blender_rendering|D#d2d1rz]].
